# Welcome to Python!

Chances are, if you're viewing this page, you're brand new to Python.
You might even be new to Programming all-together. Either way, you have come to the right place, and chosen the right language!

## Why Python?

Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming. Let me show you:


```python
print("Hello World")
```

    Hello World


And there you go! You have completed your first python code.

"print()" is a built-in Python function that will output some text to the console.

When someone says to "print to the console," they are referring to where information from your program is ouput. This might be a command prompt (CMD.exe), the terminal for Mac/Linux users, or the interactive prompt in IDLE. You will see an example of "output to console" below.

## What can Python do?
Python is a fully-functional programming language that can do anything almost any other language can do, at comparable speeds.
Python is capable of threading and GPU processing just like any other language. Most of the data processing modules are actually just Python wrappers around C/C++ code.

__"Modules"__ are pre-written Python code that you "import" in your Python program. Since there are many tasks that people commonly do, we have modules that people have written that do these tasks for you, and they usually do them in the cleanest and most efficient method possible. Sometimes you will see people refer to "DRY." This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself, which often also translates into "Don't Repeat Someone Else."

The phrase "wrapper" means that someone has placed, like a wrapper, Python code over another language. So, when you have a Python wrapper around C++ code, what someone has done is written some Python code that interacts with the C++ language. This allows you to make use of various aspects of the language being wrapped, in this case C++, without actually needing to know or understand that language.

#### Thus, Python can be used to make games, do data analysis, control robot and hardware, create GUIs, or even to create websites.

"GUI" stands for Graphical User Interface, and is used to describe a program that incorporates graphics to make the program more interactive for the user.

99% of the code that brings this very page to you is actually Python code!

## Alright what's next?

Congratulations, you have just completed one of the python tutorials.
To get started with rest of the course you will need python 3.x installed.

You can directly download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Its recommended to install anaconda if you are planning to use python for machine learning because it installs all the python libraries that you will need for implementing machine leaning code. Its really irritating to install one by one library, because for machine learning you will be using tons of libraries. And anaconda also comes with preinstalled jupyter. It's great to code ML in jupyter notebooks.

Download anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)


For those who prefer to use python without anaconda, you can download jupyter notebook [here](http://jupyter.org/install).
